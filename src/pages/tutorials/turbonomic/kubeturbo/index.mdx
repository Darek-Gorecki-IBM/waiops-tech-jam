## 4-1: Prerequisites

1) As a cluster administrator, create a project in the OCP cluster where KubeTurbo will be deployed. 

![](images/arch-1.png)

Navigate to `Home -> Projects` and click on `Create Project` button. Fill in details as below.

- Name: `kubeturbo-operator`
- Display Name: `Operator Hub based deployment of kubeturbo`

2) Click on `Create` button.

***

## 4-2:  Deploy the Operator

1) Click on `Operators -> OperatorHub`. Ensure the `kubeturbo-operator` project is selected in the dropdown.

2) Search for `kubeturbo` keyword and select `Certified` KubeTurbo operator (note, do not use Community edition)

3) Select and click on `Install` button.

4) Select options as below. Set `Update approval` as `Manual`. Automatic update is not recommended if you are not also automatically updating the Turbo Server. Click on `Install` button

5) Click on `Approve` button when `Manual approval required` prompted.

6) The operator will install and when it's ready you can view the operator (Click on `View Operator`) to create an instance, which will be your KubeTurbo probe that will monitor and manage this cluster.

## 4-3:  Configure Kubeturbo Instance

1) When viewing the deployed operator, click on `Create instance`:

2) To configure this instance click on `YAML` option.

Refer to [Configure KubeTurbo Instance](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/wiki/OpenShift-Operator-Hub-Details#configure-a-kubeturbo-instance) if you want to use `FORM` option

3) Replace all the contant in YAML editor view with the YAML config as below. **DO NOT CLICK CREATE YET!!**

```
kind: Kubeturbo
apiVersion: charts.helm.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kubeturbo-release
  namespace: kubeturbo-operator
spec:
  args:
    sccsupport: '*'
  image:
    repository: registry.connect.redhat.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo
    tag: <turbonomic server version>
  restAPIConfig:
    opsManagerPassword: <your turbonomic server password>
    opsManagerUserName: <your turbonomic server username>
  serverMeta:
    turboServer: <your turbonomic server URL, please use the topology-processor URL>
    version: <your turbonomic server version>
  targetConfig:
    targetName: <your cluster name>
```

![](images/kubeTurboCreateInstance-3.png)

4) Now, we need to replace `<your turbonomic server URL, please use the topology-processor URL>` with the actual turbonomic server URL. 

**How to get the Turbonomic Server URL?**

Go to the OCP cluster where turbonomic is installed.
![](images/arch-2.png)

Navigate to `Networking -> Routes` and select `turbonomic` project. Copy the `Location` in `topology-processor`.

![](images/turboTopologyProcessorRoute.png)

Go back to your YAML editor view in Step 3 earlier. Assign it to `turboServer` value.

![](images/kubeturboCreateInstance-4.png)

5) Next, replace the `<your turbonomic server version>` with the actual turbonomic server version.

**How to get the Turbonomic Server Version?**

Go back the OCP cluster where turbonomic is installed.
![](images/arch-2.png)

Navigate to `Networking -> Routes` and select `turbonomic` project. Click on the `Location` in `api`.

![](images/turboApiRoute.png)  

It will bring up the Turbonomic UI page as below. Check the version in the page.

![](images/checkTurboVersion.png)

Go back to your YAML editor view in Step 3 earlier. Assign it to 

- `image` -> `tag` value
- `serverMeta` -> `version` value  

![](images/kubeturboCreateInstance-5.png)

6) Then replace the values of `<your turbonomic server password>` and `<your turbonomic server username>` with the credentials that you have used to login Turbonomic UI in Section 2.5 earlier.

![](images/kubeturboCreateInstance-6.png)

7) When you have applied your configuration you will see that you have created an instance, or custom resource, called `kubeturbo-release`:

## 4-4:  Validate Deployment

1) You will now see two deployments and two running pods in the namespace. One is the operator, and the other is the Kubeturbo probe (release)

Navigate to `Workloads -> Pods` and select `kubeturbo-operator` project:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evat-pm/images/master/KOH-runningPods.png?raw=true)

Navigate to `Workloads -> Deployment` and select `kubeturbo-operator` project:

![Kubeturbo validate deployments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evat-pm/images/master/KOH-deployments.png?raw=true)

2) Look at the log of the `kubeturbo-release` pod (In `Workloads -> Pods`) to validate that the probe has successfully connected, registered with the Turbo Server, and a full discovery has occurred. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evat-pm/images/master/KOH-successLog.png?raw=true)

3) Validate the target in the Turbonomic Server UI

Go to your Turbonomic Server UI -> `Settings` -> `Target Configuration` and you will see a new target display with the name `Kubernetes-<your cluster name>`
