6. Here, we can see come key application metrics provided by Instana ï¿½ e.g. response time and transaction and how they have evolved over time. Turbonomic uses that data to provided actionable insights based on that data in the form of recommended actions you could take to improve performance and/or improve efficiency.

You will noticed either yellow or red and green sections of the circles on `Container Cluster` section of the Business Application Tree on the left side of the screen.

7. Click that circle and it will take you to a screen like this below. You will notice that there are `Pending Actions` that Turbonomic suggests will improve the performance and efficiency of the application.

Turbonomic does not recommend actions for a Business Application, Transactions, or Services, but it does recommend actions for the underlying Application Components and infrastructure entities, thus providing visibility into the risks that have a direct impact on the Business Application's performance.
